# Green Goblin

## Project Overview

The **Green Goblin** project is a note-taking application developed using C# and the .NET Framework. The goal of this project was to create a desktop-based application similar to Google Keep, enabling users to create, edit, categorize, and manage their notes efficiently. The application focuses on providing a simple and intuitive user interface while offering advanced features like categorization, reminders, and data persistence.

Designed for users who require a reliable system to organize their daily tasks and thoughts, **Green Goblin** helps them stay productive and manage their work or personal life effectively. It serves as a perfect tool for those who prefer a desktop environment for managing their tasks and notes.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: The core programming language used for developing the application, chosen for its efficiency and seamless integration with the .NET Framework.

- **.NET Framework**: Used to build the application’s user interface and handle backend logic, allowing for a clean, efficient, and scalable application.

- **Windows Forms**: The graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit used to create interactive windows, buttons, text fields, and other components of the app.

- **SQL Database**: Used to store notes, categories, and user data, ensuring that users’ notes are persistent and retrievable.

## Key Features

- **Note Creation and Editing**: Users can easily create new notes, type in their thoughts or tasks, and save them for future reference. Each note can be updated or deleted, providing full control over content.

- **Categorization**: Users can assign categories to their notes (e.g., Work, Personal, Ideas), making it easier to filter and find notes later based on the category.

- **Reminder System**: Users can set reminders for specific notes, ensuring they receive a notification at the set time, which is particularly useful for task management.

- **Search Functionality**: A powerful search feature allows users to quickly find notes by keywords, helping locate specific notes without scrolling through the entire list.

- **Data Persistence**: Using a SQL database, all notes, categories, and user settings are saved persistently, allowing users to continue from where they left off when reopening the app.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The clean and intuitive user interface makes navigation easy, allowing new users to adapt quickly without a steep learning curve.

- **Cross-Platform Flexibility (Potential)**: Although currently a desktop application, it can be expanded to support cross-platform development using .NET Core for other operating systems like macOS and Linux.

## Challenges Faced

- **Database Integration**: Ensuring smooth integration between the application and the SQL database was challenging, particularly with data retrieval and saving. This was resolved by optimizing SQL queries and data handling methods.

- **Reminder Functionality**: Implementing the reminder system required careful planning to track time and alert users, even when the app wasn’t actively running. This involved integrating background processes, which required extensive testing to ensure reliability.

- **Search Optimization**: Optimizing the search feature for speed and accuracy, even with many notes, was a significant hurdle. This involved refining the search algorithm for quick retrieval without slowing down the app's performance.

## Final Outcome

The **Green Goblin** note-taking application was successfully developed, offering users a feature-rich yet simple solution for organizing their notes. Ideal for individuals needing to manage various tasks, ideas, and reminders in one place, the app's clean interface, categorization, and reminder system enable users to efficiently keep track of their day-to-day activities.

The categorization feature received positive feedback, as it helped users group related notes for easier access. The reminder system proved valuable for time-sensitive tasks, ensuring users never missed deadlines or important events.

The app’s data persistence feature allows users to rely on **Green Goblin** for safely storing all their notes, even if the app closes unexpectedly or the machine reboots, adding a layer of reliability appreciated by users.

## Conclusion

The **Green Goblin** project provided an excellent opportunity to delve deeper into desktop application development with C# and the .NET Framework. By integrating a SQL database for data persistence and enhancing the app with features like reminders and search, a highly functional and user-friendly application was created. This project demonstrates my skills in software development, particularly in building applications that combine functionality with a clean user interface, ensuring data security and persistence.
